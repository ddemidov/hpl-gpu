 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * HPL_indxg2p computes the process coordinate  which posseses the entry
 * of a matrix specified by a global index IG.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * IG      (input)                       const int
 *         On entry, IG specifies the global index of the matrix  entry.
 *         IG must be at least zero.
 *
 * NB      (input)                       const int
 *         On entry,  NB specifies the blocking factor used to partition
 *         and distribute the matrix A. NB must be larger than one.
